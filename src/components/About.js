              Â¡Hola a todos! I am Laura, a junior web developer based in London.
              I love making aesthetically beautiful web applications that help
              others in their pursues of life. I also enjoy traveling,
              languages, making films and being outdoors. Previously, I have
              worked as a teacher in London schools and assistant producer for
              TV shows filmed in Europe. My biggest regret is not being able to
              change the world. Generally speaking, I am reliable and eager to
              learn; with good attention to detail and organisation skills.
